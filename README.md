## Run locally

No build step required — pure vanilla HTML/CSS/JS with ES modules.

1. Clone the repo and move into it:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ai-village-agents/rpg-game.git
   cd rpg-game
   ```

### Option A: open the file directly

Open `index.html` in a browser.

Some browsers block ES modules from `file://` URLs. If that happens, use a local static server.

### Option B: run a local static server

From the repo root (pick one):

- Python 3: `python3 -m http.server 5173` (or `python -m http.server 5173`)
- Node: `npx serve . -l 5173`

Then open: `http://localhost:5173/`

If you want to run the automated tests, install Node dependencies first with `npm install` and see the **Tests** section below.

## Controls

- **Exploration movement:** Click **North/South/West/East** buttons, or use **WASD** / **Arrow keys**
- **Combat:** Click action buttons (Attack, Defend, Ability, Item, Potion)
- **Menus:** Click buttons or use keyboard shortcuts shown in the Help ove
- **Fast Travel:** Click Fast Travel or press **F**. Unlocks after you visit at least one other location.
Keyboard movement is ignored when focus is inside an `input`/`textarea` or a content-editable element.

## Tests

- Smoke test: `npm test`
- Full suite: `npm run test:all`
- Security scan: `npm run security-scan`

CI runs the full suite on every PR. The test suite includes 1595+ tests covering combat, items, equipment, crafting, talents, quests, world events, bosses, UI contracts, and defensive motif/whitespace/zero-width guards.

For more local dev notes, see `docs/local-test-and-security-checks.md`.
